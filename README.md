### Hey, I'm Ramses 👋

I'm a 21 year old developer.

## 🔭 Current

Currently working as a freelance developer writing custom solutions for sneaker-based projects and information distribution in NodeJS (and learning Go/Python as I go)

## ⚡️ Experience

I've been a front-end developer for about 5 years now. I recently started back-end development around 2 years ago with JS and have expanded since then into Java, Python, and most recently Golang.
